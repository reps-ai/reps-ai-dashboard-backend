# Reps AI Dashboard Backend - Repository Documentation

## 1. Introduction

The Reps AI Dashboard Backend is a sophisticated FastAPI application designed to power an AI Voice Agent system specifically tailored for fitness gyms. This backend serves as the central hub for managing gym operations, including lead management, automated call handling, appointment scheduling, and analytics tracking.

The application follows a multi-tenant architecture where multiple gyms can use the platform simultaneously while maintaining data isolation between tenants. Each gym can have multiple branches, staff users, and specific configurations.

## 2. System Overview

- Track and manage potential customer leads
- Schedule and analyze calls with potential customers
- Book and manage appointments
- Configure and deploy AI voice agents for automated customer interactions
- Maintain a knowledge base to guide AI responses
- Access analytics and performance metrics

### 2.2 Core Technologies

- **FastAPI**: Modern, high-performance web framework
- **PostgreSQL**: Primary database
- **Redis**: Caching and temporary data storage
- **Celery**: Task queue for asynchronous operations
- **Alembic**: Database migration management
- **Pydantic**: Data validation and settings management
- **SQLAlchemy**: ORM for database operations
- **Retell API**: Integration for AI voice agent capabilities

```

The application is built on a layered architecture with clear separation of concerns:

1. **API Layer**: Handles HTTP requests/responses and input validation
2. **Service Layer**: Contains business logic and orchestration
3. **Repository Layer**: Manages data access and persistence
4. **Background Tasks**: Handles asynchronous operations

### 3.2 Multi-tenant Design

The system is designed with multi-tenancy at its core:

- Each gym is a separate tenant with isolated data
- Gyms can have multiple branches
- Users belong to specific gyms and can only access data from their gym
- Role-based permissions control access within a gym

## 4. Project Structure

The repository follows a modular structure organized by feature domains:

- `tests/cache_test.py`: Tests for caching mechanisms. Common error source: test isolation issues, Redis mock configuration.
- `tests/http_cache_benchmark.py`: Performance benchmarks for HTTP caching. Common error source: benchmark environment inconsistencies.

### 12.14 Utility Scripts

- `scripts/api_test.py`: Manual API testing utility. Common error source: hardcoded endpoint paths, authentication issues.
- `scripts/api_stress_test.py`: Load testing for API endpoints. Common error source: rate limiting, connection pooling issues.
- `scripts/hash_passwords.py`: Utility to hash passwords for user setup. Common error source: algorithm configuration mismatches.
- `scripts/leads_stress_test.py`: Load testing for lead management. Common error source: database connection limits, transaction isolation issues.
- `scripts/fix_alembic.py`: Script to repair Alembic migration issues. Common error source: migration version conflicts.
- `scripts/neon_db_helper.py`: Utilities for Neon database interactions. Common error source: connection string formatting, pooling configuration.

## 13. Common Issues and Troubleshooting

### 13.1 Authentication Issues
- **JWT Token Expiration**: Check token expiration settings in `backend/config/settings.py`.
- **Authentication Failures**: Verify password hashing in `backend/services/auth/implementation.py`.
- **Permission Errors**: Check role assignments in database and role validation in `app/routes/auth/dependencies.py`.

### 13.2 Database Connection Issues
- **Connection Pool Exhaustion**: Review pool settings in `backend/db/connections/database.py`.
- **Transaction Deadlocks**: Check transaction isolation levels and long-running transactions.
- **Migration Failures**: Inspect Alembic migration files for conflicts or dependencies.

### 13.3 Performance Issues
- **Slow API Responses**: Check for missing indexes, N+1 query problems in repositories.
- **Cache Ineffectiveness**: Review cache invalidation strategies and TTL settings.
- **Background Task Delays**: Monitor Celery worker queue lengths and task execution times.

### 13.4 Integration Issues
- **Retell API Failures**: Check API key validity and request formatting in `backend/integrations/retell/client.py`.
- **Webhook Processing Errors**: Verify webhook signature validation and event handlers.
- **Notification Delivery Failures**: Check service provider credentials and rate limits.

### 13.5 Deployment Issues
- **Container Startup Failures**: Check environment variable configuration in Docker files.
- **Memory Consumption**: Monitor Redis cache size and database connection pool settings.
- **Worker Process Crashes**: Review PM2 logs and Celery worker error logs.
