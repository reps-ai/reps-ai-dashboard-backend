# Your rule content
This is the rule system for my reps ai backend project. 
The architecture is very simple. 
1. FastAPI app that opens up our API's so that our frontend can talk to this backend.
2. We have a backend layer that actually performs the required operations for the API layer, this includes talking to the database, perfoming background tasks, and more. 
3. Our backend layer is broken down into more layers. 
    a. Service Layer - Serves as a template with HOW we talk to our CRM, can be internal or external (in our case it's internal and is a database repo)
    b. Database repository - Standardizes how we talk to our database so we have plug and play functionality with different providers by just calling the required functions. 
    c. Integrations layer where we have connected retell ai for the voice agent. 
- You can @ files here
  [main.py](mdc:main.py) is the main fastAPI app.
- You can use markdown but dont have to
1. You need to ensure that you are checking our code version from [requirements.txt](mdc:requirements.txt) and make sure that the code you are writing is in accordance with that.
2. WHENEVER you don't have ALL the information you need, you need to stop me and clarify it. 
3. You are expected to perform code runs DIRECTLY in the agent window to verify that your scripts are working and to debug.
