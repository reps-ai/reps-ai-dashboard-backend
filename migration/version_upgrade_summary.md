# Dependency Version Upgrade Summary

This document summarizes the upgrades made to key dependencies and highlights potential issues to watch for.

## Major Upgrades

| Package | From | To | Key Changes |
|---------|------|---|------------|
| Pydantic | 1.10.7 | 2.6.4 | API changes, validation behavior differences |
| FastAPI | 0.95.0 | 0.110.0 | Pydantic v2 compatibility, response model handling |
| SQLAlchemy | 2.0.9 | 2.0.29 | Type support improvements, ORM enhancements |
| Uvicorn | 0.21.1 | 0.27.1 | Bug fixes, HTTP protocol improvements |

## Files Updated

- Updated `requirements.txt` with current versions
- Updated `app/dependencies.py` Pydantic models to use v2 style
- Converted `app/auth/oauth2.py` TokenData class to a proper Pydantic model
- Updated SQLAlchemy model in `backend/db/models/user.py` to use typed notation
- Updated `backend/db/base.py` to use newer SQLAlchemy import style
- Updated various schemas throughout the app to use Pydantic v2 patterns 
- Added response models and status codes to FastAPI routes for better type safety

## Automated Updates

The script at `migration/update_models.py` was used to find and update:
- 20 files with Pydantic models in the `app` directory
- 11 files with Pydantic models in the `backend` directory

The script automatically updated:
- Validator decorators (`@validator` → `@field_validator`)
- Model configuration (from class Config to model_config = ConfigDict())
- Dict method calls (`.dict()` → `.model_dump()`)
- ORM mode settings (`orm_mode=True` → `from_attributes=True`)

## Potential Issues to Watch For

### Pydantic v2 Changes

1. **Validation Behavior**: Pydantic v2 is more strict by default. Watch for failed validations.
2. **Type Coercion**: Pydantic v2 is less aggressive about coercing types.
3. **Error Messages**: Validation error formats have changed.
4. **JSON Schema Generation**: Has different output format.
5. **Root Models**: RootModel handling if your application uses it.

### FastAPI Changes

1. **Response Models**: May need adjustments if you relied on Pydantic v1-specific features.
2. **Dependencies**: Watch for any dependency function issues with new Pydantic models.
3. **OpenAPI Schema**: May appear different in Swagger UI.

### SQLAlchemy Changes

1. **QuerySet Compatibility**: Ensure any custom query logic works with the newer version.
2. **ORM Event Handling**: Monitor any custom event listeners or hooks.

### Uvicorn Changes

1. **Request State Handling**: The bug with `request.state` persistence has been fixed.
2. **WebSocket Behavior**: May have subtle changes in timeout or error handling.

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**: Run all unit tests and fix any failures.
2. **API Testing**: Test all endpoints for correct responses and error handling.
3. **Performance Testing**: Compare performance before and after upgrades.
4. **Regression Testing**: Ensure all existing features still work as expected.

## Rollback Plan

If serious issues are encountered:

1. Restore the original `requirements.txt`
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to reinstall the original versions
3. Consider rolling back key code changes if necessary

## Next Steps

1. Run thorough testing of all upgraded components
2. Monitor for any issues in development environment before deploying to production
3. Update documentation to reflect new dependency versions and APIs
