# Services Layer

## Overview

The services layer implements the core business logic of the AI Dashboard backend. It follows a clean architecture pattern with interfaces, implementations, and factories for each service domain. The services are designed to be modular, maintainable, and testable.

## Directory Structure

```
services/
├── analytics/     # Analytics and reporting service
├── call/         # Call processing service
├── campaign/     # Campaign management service
└── lead/         # Lead management service
```

Each service follows a consistent structure:

```
service_name/
├── __init__.py
├── interface.py      # Abstract base class defining the service interface
├── implementation.py # Concrete implementation of the service
└── factory.py       # Factory for creating service instances
```

## Service Architecture

### Interface Layer

Each service defines its interface through an abstract base class that specifies:

- Required methods and their signatures
- Input/output types
- Documentation for each method
- Business rules and constraints

Example interface (from `lead/interface.py`):

```python
@abstractmethod
async def get_prioritized_leads(
    self,
    gym_id: str,
    count: int,
    qualification: Optional[str] = None,
    exclude_leads: Optional[List[str]] = None
) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """
    Get prioritized leads for a gym based on qualification criteria.
    """
    pass
```

### Implementation Layer

- Concrete implementation of the service interface
- Handles business logic and data transformations
- Interacts with repositories for data access
- Implements error handling and validation
- Manages service dependencies

### Factory Layer

- Creates service instances with required dependencies
- Handles dependency injection
- Manages service lifecycle
- Provides configuration options

## Core Services

### Analytics Service

Purpose: Data analysis and reporting

- Performance metrics calculation
- Report generation
- Data aggregation and transformation
- Trend analysis

### Call Service

Purpose: Call processing and management

- Call handling and routing
- Recording management
- Call outcome tracking
- Integration with voice systems

### Campaign Service

Purpose: Campaign management

- Campaign creation and configuration
- Campaign scheduling
- Performance tracking
- Resource allocation

### Lead Service

Purpose: Lead management and tracking

- Lead data management
- Lead qualification
- Lead prioritization
- Status tracking
- Tag management
- Call outcome updates

## Best Practices

### 1. Interface Design

- Use clear and descriptive method names
- Document all methods with docstrings
- Define explicit input/output types
- Keep interfaces focused and cohesive
- Use abstract base classes for interfaces

### 2. Implementation

- Follow single responsibility principle
- Implement proper error handling
- Add logging for important operations
- Keep business logic separate from data access
- Use dependency injection for flexibility

### 3. Error Handling

- Define domain-specific exceptions
- Handle errors at appropriate levels
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Log errors with proper context
- Implement graceful fallbacks

### 4. Testing

- Write unit tests for business logic
- Mock dependencies in tests
- Test error cases and edge conditions
- Use integration tests for critical paths
- Maintain high test coverage

### 5. Performance

- Implement caching where appropriate
- Use async/await for I/O operations
- Optimize database queries
- Monitor service performance
- Handle rate limiting

## Dependencies

- Database layer for data persistence
- Task queue for background processing
- External integrations (AI services, voice systems)
- Configuration management
- Logging system

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Service Instance

```python
from services.lead.factory import LeadServiceFactory

# Create a service instance with dependencies
lead_service = LeadServiceFactory.create(
    db_session=session,
    config=config
)

# Use the service
leads = await lead_service.get_prioritized_leads(
    gym_id="123",
    count=10,
    qualification="hot"
)
```

### Error Handling

```python
try:
    result = await service.process_call(call_data)
except CallProcessingError as e:
    # Handle specific error
    logger.error(f"Call processing failed: {e}")
    raise
except Exception as e:
    # Handle unexpected errors
    logger.error(f"Unexpected error: {e}")
    raise ServiceError("Internal service error")
```

## Contributing

When adding new functionality to services:

1. Start by defining the interface
2. Document all methods thoroughly
3. Implement the concrete service
4. Add factory methods if needed
5. Write comprehensive tests
6. Update relevant documentation

### Adding a New Service

1. Create a new directory under `services/`
2. Define the service interface
3. Implement the service
4. Create a factory
5. Add tests
6. Update documentation

### Modifying Existing Services

1. Ensure backward compatibility
2. Update interface documentation
3. Add/update tests
4. Update implementation
5. Test thoroughly
6. Update documentation

## Monitoring and Maintenance

- Monitor service performance
- Track error rates
- Monitor resource usage
- Update dependencies regularly
- Perform security audits
- Review and optimize code
